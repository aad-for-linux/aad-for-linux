Everyone interacting in the project's codebases, issue trackers, chat
rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting an Issue

Please include as much detail as you can. Let us know your platform and relevant
version numbers for the project in question. If the problem is visual (for example a theme or design issue)
please add a screenshot and if you get an error please include the full error and traceback.

## Submitting Pull Requests

Once you are happy with your changes or you are ready for some feedback, push
it to your fork and send a pull request. For a change to be accepted it will
